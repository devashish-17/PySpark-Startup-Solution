# StartUps_Spark_Solution

This project utilizes Apache Spark to analyze startup data incubated in various centers across India. The notebook demonstrates the following:
- Creation of a Spark session
- Loading and displaying the initial dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including splitting location data into state and city
- Performing various transformations and aggregations on the data

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the distribution and sector focus of startups incubated in different centers.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and splitting location data.
- Data Transformation: Aggregating and summarizing data based on different criteria.
- Spark SQL: Leveraging Spark SQL functions to manipulate and query large datasets efficiently.
